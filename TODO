-- option for tile resolution

solve the follwing by making this a lib with python bindings and doing the annoying parts in python?
-- automatically download elevation tiles

-- load picture and superimpose stuff?

-- draw other features such as rivers, islands! ...
-- mark lakes and the sea in some way
-- cmake
-- better visibility criterion for peaks and other features
