first, don't write to pic but to 2d array of height x width

iterate over all little squares of the landscape
  calc covered pixels and their distance
  if they are not drawn with a closer distance yet:
    write distance to all pixels

finally, translate distance to color and write pixels


(
  how does one draw hill tops?
  some shadings?
)
